unchained-prototype
===================

This prototype will focus on creating a web application using Ruby on Rails and Nginx + Unicorn to setup de web server.

1. Choose something simple you would like to create (Ex: To-do List for your course projects)
2. Try to get it done on Ruby on Rails ;)
3. Implementing CRUD operations, create, read, update and delete tasks, and REST services is a <strong>plus</strong> (RESTful way).

<h1>Technologies</h1>
<ul>
  <li>You will need to setup a Unix Ruby HTTP Server called Unicorn.</li>
  <li>You will need to setup Unicorn with Nginx.</li>
  <li>You will need to learn Ruby language.</li>
  <li>You will need to learn the the basic principles of MVC (Model, View, Controller) and RESTful design is a <strong>plus</strong>.
  <li>You will code your web application using Ruby on Rails framework.</li>
  <li>You will use git as a concurrent version control and to deploy your apps.</li>
  <li>You will use Twitter Bootstrap / ZURB Foundation to ease the development of the frontend (HTML5, CSS, JS).</li>
  <li>You will need to create the schema using a database, MySQL or PostegreSQL, (we should talk about this later) to save info from your app. (Ex: your tasks).</li>
</ul>

<h1>Recommended Tools</h1>
<ul>
<li>iTerm2 ( a better terminal if you wish)</li>
<li>ghi to work with github issues on terminal</li>
<li>vagrant to create your VM instance instead of working on your local machine.</li>
<li>Chrome Developer Tools to frontend debug</li>
</ul>

<h1>Requirements</h1>
<ul>
<li>Implement Test Driven Development</li>
<li>At least backend code should be tested (UnitTest)</li>
We should talk about this later with the client.
</ul>

<h1>Issues</h1>
All issues should go to this GitHub repository Issues.

<h1>Recommended Documentation</h1>

<li>http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/</li>
</ul>

<h1>Deadlines</h1>
As the learning process is slow, I suggest:
<ul>
<li>21 Feb - Start exploring the technologies and methodologies.</li>
<li>1 Mar - You should have a grasp knowledge of all the development stack, start developing the prototype.</li>
<li>8 Mar - Deliver the prototype.</li>
</ul>
This will be some hard days, but are of the most importance for you to learn and "mastering" Ruby on Rails and web application development.
